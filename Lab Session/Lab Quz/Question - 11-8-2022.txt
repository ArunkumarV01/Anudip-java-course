In Java, inheritance is an is-a relationship. That is, we use inheritance only if there exists an is-a relationship between two classes. For example,

Car is a Vehicle
Orange is a Fruit
Surgeon is a Doctor
Dog is an Animal
Here, Car can inherit from Vehicle, Orange can inherit from Fruit, and so on.
